# 60dire

60 dire is a 60 day challenge. It is inspired by 75 Hard. The rules are:

1. Drink 4L water everyday.
1. Commit and stick to a diet for the entire duration.
1. Read 10 pages of nonfiction every day, audiobooks don't count.
1. One 45 min workout everyday.
1. Record (or share with someone) your favorite part of the day. There is always one!
1. Commit and stick to a sleep for the entire duration.

That's it. If you fail on any of these for a day, you must restart again.
